            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Company </h4>
            <p>The company plays a vital role in our life. That is why Islam gives more importance to the company of a scholar that mere prayers. We can also touch the heights of glory if we are very careful about our company.A man is known by the company he keeps/ just as a tree is known by the fruit it bears. Our associates have great influence on our character. A good and virtuous man will, by the silent influence of his example, make us good, a wicked man will make us wicked like himself. Hundreds of young men are led astray by bad companions. It is very easy to yield to temptations.Having a good company around you will benefit you in the long run. The positivity, hardworking nature and other good qualities in your company would inspire you and would also show in your behavior.
                If you surround yourself with harmful and toxic people, they will bring your confidence down and will impact your behavior negatively. Cutting up the negativity from your life would help to lift up your mood and spirit.
                It is essential to give importance to the right people around you and always surround yourself with good company. Good people motivate you, fill you with positivity, and this boosts your confidence overall.
                A good company supports you in hard times and help you thrive and prosper. A bad company, on the other hand, suppresses you and make you feel a sense of negativity.
                If in any case you are surrounded by people who don’t make you feel good, and you don’t feel happy around them then take a step back and think again. It is time to cut any negativity from your life and have a good company with you.

                We must choose our companions with very great care. We must shun bad company as poison. In all religions, the company of the virtuous is recommended as a means of spiritual betterment. If we make bad friends, they will spoil our all efforts and bring us disgrace. On the other hand, if someone has good friends, they will bring him honor. It will help him to make progress in life.
                
                Good men will raise us to their level. Men more learned and experienced than ourselves will guide us aright through the difficulties of life. Their example and their teachings will ennoble us, raise our thoughts, place high ideals before us, and encourage us to do right. They would give us solace in times of distress, and confer peace of mind on us. Young men should always prefer the company of men wiser and better than themselves.
                
                It is a law of nature that we become like those with whom we live, and if we do not sit in the company of men who are better than ourselves, we shall never improve. If we have something good and noble to look up to, we shall imitate it, and if we have a low and vulgar example before us. we shall follow it, and become like – it. The importance of good company for the elevation of character cannot be overrated.</p><br><br>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Team</h4>
            <p>Team is working together of people to achieve a certain goal. Teamwork is the basic need for an organization to function. Furthermore, every organization has a division of several teams to perform specific tasks.

                Without teamwork nothing is possible. Moreover, if any organization lacks teamwork. Then it will hamper its success rate. Thus the organization will fall. Also, it will affect the environment the people are working in.
                
                Furthermore, the organization has a different hierarchy of teamwork. So that the workload gets divided. And each team has an expert who guides different team members with his prior experience team of the organization decides the goals of the company. Furthermore, they understand the need for different sectors of society. And makes policies to maximize the profit of the company. Moreover, it also works on the development of the company and its employees.Teamwork has the greatest importance in any part of the world. Whether it be an organization or a small business. Teamwork is the key to success. In our schools, we play many sports that enlist teamwork.

                Thus from our childhood only we knew about teamwork. Because our mentors understood the importance of teamwork. That is the reason they always guided us on the right path.
                
                At last, the teamwork team generates a relationship between two people. As we all know that human is a social being, so it is beneficial for the environment of a person.The middle level consists of the manager and the Supervisors. This team of workers focuses on the implementation of the policies made by the Top-level. Furthermore, the team assigns various tasks to the employee sector, so that they may work towards the goals of the company. Moreover, the Middle level inspects and keeps a regular check on their work.

                In short, they bridge the gap between the top level and the middle level. In order to be a part of this team, a person should be qualified enough. Because this ensures that the person is having the knowledge of all the work he is assigning to the employees.
                
                Only then the person would be capable enough to guide the lower level. Above all the main work is to meet the demands of the employee, so that the organization can work in a better way.The Lower Level consists of the employees. They work on the tasks assigned to them by the Middle Level. The coordination of teamwork is much needed in the employment sector. As the need to submit each task within a period of time.

                So that the organization may run smoothly. The base of the organization is the employment sector. As without them, the application of policies isn’t possible.</p><br><br>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Services</h4>
            <p>Service is a word that we always use in our daily lives. It acts as an important role in many businesses and is a leading indicator to measure customer loyalty. Service is a kind of product that is not physical and not tangible such as some medical care and food delivery. These are the things that people cannot touch or feel. Kolter (2000) suggested that a service is an act or performance that one party can offer to another that is essentially intangible and does not result in the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not be tied to a physical product. Although services seem to be different from products, there are some suggestions show that there is a relationship between them.

                Service dominant logic (SDL) is another way to see service. The conventional nation views service as the dominant logic for marketing. However, under the service dominant logic, it is viewed that service is the governing marketing phenomenon as it unifies different relationships from marketing to production and from consumption to resource pronouncement. Vargo and Lush (2004) define is SDL implies that all businesses are service businesses and covers all economic and social activities. They also mention that service is the exchange of service and it is the main process of using resources to benefit other parties. The idea of SDL is not about exchanging knowledge and between producers and consumers. It is mainly about how the consumers integrate, apply and use the resources to a specific producer. For example, some families use the lawn robot every day which is a complex technical product. It helps to maintain the length of the grass. The same service can be provided by a gardener who can mow the lawn three times a week. It shows that the lawn robot provides a service with lower prices and greater reliability. However, the prerequisites are that we have to know how to use the machine and install the technical boundary wires. It depends on our ability, knowledge as users of the service and willingness to co-create in this context and it determines the value of the product. Therefore, service dominant logic shows that products may not be different from services. A company can offer potential value to customers without direct interaction. The value co-creation between firms and consumers has capabilities of combining their skills, experiences and knowledge. It means that the product has no value until an offering is used as customers are always a co creator of value.
                
                One of the main areas for consumers to purchase services is consumer experience. Consumer experience is based on the effective communication efforts its package and interaction between consumers and employees. It is the internal and subjective response customers have to any direct or indirect contact with the company (Schwager and Meyer, 2007). Emotions and moods are factors that can influence consumers’ experience. According to the interpersonal theory of emotions (Parkinson, 1995), emotions and their expression are elicited in the context of an implicit or explicit social situation and are perhaps the most proximate variables to an individual’s reaction to an event and any subsequent cognition or action. Oliver (1997) suggested that positive emotions increasing satisfaction while negative emotions decreasing satisfaction.</p><br><br>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4"> Products</h4>
            <p>A product description is a copy on your product page that is used to explain the features and benefits of your product. It successfully answers all the questions your customers might have, including product detail and information not otherwise evident through product images and videos.

                The length of the product description varies from product to product. The more information you include in your product description copy, the better the chances your customers would purchase the product.In the example above, you can see that the product name, as well as the description, perfectly communicates all the important elements of this product.

                That fact is that even this product description falls flat when it comes to persuading your customers to hit the “Buy” button.
